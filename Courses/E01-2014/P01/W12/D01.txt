1- Review the lesson we learned in our class in less than 5'.

2- In 50', listen to all files from 'D01 - AAT - D1 04 xxx.wma' to 'D01 - AAT - D1 23 xxx.wma'. Read 'D01 - AAT - Lesson.pdf' while you are listening.
Notes:
- 'D01 - AAT - D1 04 xx.wma' corresponds to Disk 1 track 04.
- Focus on these exercises: 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-6, 1-9, 1-13, 1-15. Listen and repeat these exercises as much as you can.
