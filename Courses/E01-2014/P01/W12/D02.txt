1- Within 8', listen to 'D02 - Sound counting.mp3' at least twice. For each time, count and record the number of leading /t/ sounds (âm /t/ đứng đầu âm tiết). 

2- In less than 30', do as instructed all parts of the unit in 'D02 - Lesson.pdf'.
Note:
- All files to listen to in day 2 have their names prefixed with 'D02'. For example, 'D02 - B91.mp3' corresponds to the listening task B91.
- If you don't print out 'D02 - Lesson.pdf', then please record your answers into your notebook.
- When you listen to the words, try to repeat them as loudly as possible. 

3- Within 10', quickly skim through 'D02 - Lesson.pdf' and take notes of what to remember in the sections '3 Dialogue - a', '4 Intonation in questions'.

4- Within 12', give phonetic transcription for these sentences:
	- The sound /b/ is loud before a vowel and is often quiet before a consonant or at the end of a word.
	- In Yes/No questions, intonation usually begins to go up on the most important word for the speaker's meaning.
	- In WH questions, intonation goes down or up depending on whether we want to ask for new information or check old information.
Then let ImTranslator read the text and repeat it as loudly as possible.
	
You have finished day 2. Congratulations :)!
