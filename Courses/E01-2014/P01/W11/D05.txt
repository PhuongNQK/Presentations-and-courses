1- Within 5', review the points in parts 4 and 5 of Day 4.

2- Within 8', listen to 'D05 - Sound counting.mp3' at least twice. For each time, count and record the number of /b/ sounds. 

3- In less than 30', do as instructed all parts of the unit in 'D05 - Lesson.pdf'.
Note:
- All files to listen to in day 5 have their names prefixed with 'D05'. For example, 'D04 - B83.mp3' corresponds to the listening task B83.
- If you don't print out 'D05 - Lesson.pdf', then please record your answers into your notebook.
- When you listen to the words, try to repeat them as loudly as possible. 

4- Within 5', quickly skim through 'D05 - Lesson.pdf' and take notes of what to remember about the sound /b/ (in the section '3 Dialogue - a') and about word stress and stop sounds (in the sections '4 Stress and intonation - a,c').

5- Within 5', give phonetic transcription for these sentences:
	- The sound /b/ is loud before a vowel, and fairly loud before 'l' or 'r'.
	- The sound /b/ is often quiet before a consonant or at the end of a word.
Then let ImTranslator read the text and repeat it as loudly as possible.
	
6- Within 7', listen to files 'D05 - Pairs - D48.mp3' (/n/ vs. /l/) and 'D05 - Pairs - D49.mp3' (/l/ vs. /r/). Write down each word you here using this format:
	/pronunciation/ <word> - /pronunciation/ <word>
	E.g. /ʃiːp/ sheep - /ʃɪp/ ship

Congratulations for having finished day 5 :)!
