1- Within 5', review the points in parts 3 and 4 of Day 3.

2- Within 10', listen to 'D04 - Sound counting.mp3' at least twice. For each time, count and record the number of /p/ sounds. 

3- In less than 30', do as instructed all parts of the unit in 'D04 - Lesson.pdf'.
Note:
- All files to listen to in day 4 have their names prefixed with 'D04'. For example, 'D04 - B78.mp3' corresponds to the listening task B78.
- If you don't print out 'D04 - Lesson.pdf', then please record your answers into your notebook.
- When you listen to the words, try to repeat them as loudly as possible. 

4- Within 5', quickly skim through 'D04 - Lesson.pdf' and take notes of what to remember about the sound /p/ (in the section '3 Dialogue - a') and about intonation (in the section '4 Stress and intonation - b').

5- Within 10', give phonetic transcription for these sentences:
	- The sound /p/ is louder before a vowel, and fairly loud before 'l' or 'r'.
	- The sound /p/ is often quieter at the end of a word. It is usually quiet and sometimes almost silent before a consonant.
	- Intonation usually goes down on the last strongly stressed word in a sentence. In a list, the intonation goes up with each item but down on the last item.
Then let ImTranslator read the text and repeat it as loudly as possible.
	
Congratulations for having finished day 4 :)!
