1- Within 5', listen to 'D03 - Sound counting.mp3' at least twice. For each time, count and record the number of /eə/ sounds. 

2- In less than 30', do as instructed all parts of the unit in 'D03 - Lesson.pdf'.
Note:
- All files to listen to in day 3 have their names prefixed with 'D03'. For example, 'D03 - B70.mp3' corresponds to the listening task B70.
- If you don't print out 'D03 - Lesson.pdf', then please record your answers into your notebook.
- When you listen to the words, try to repeat them as loudly as possible. 

3- Within 5', quickly skim through 'D03 - Lesson.pdf' and take notes of what to remember in the section "The letter 'r' - pronounced or silent".

4- Within 10', give phonetic transcription for these sentences:
	Word stress doesn't usually change while sentence stress changes with the speaker's meaning. The most important words for the speaker's meaning are strongly stressed.
Then let ImTranslator read the text and repeat it as loudly as possible.
	
5- Within 10', listen to files 'D03 - Pairs - D47a.mp3' (/n/ vs. /ŋ/) and 'D03 - Pairs - D47b.mp3' (/ŋk/ and /ŋ/). Write down each word you here using this format:
	/pronunciation/ <word> - /pronunciation/ <word>
	E.g. /ʃiːp/ sheep - /ʃɪp/ ship
	
You have finished day 3. Congratulations :)!
