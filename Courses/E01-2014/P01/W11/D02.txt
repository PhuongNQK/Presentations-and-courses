1- Within 6', listen to 'D02 - Sound counting.mp3' at least twice. For each time, count and record the number of /ɪə/ sounds. 

2- In less than 34', do as instructed all parts of the unit in 'D02 - Lesson.pdf'.
Note:
- All files to listen to in day 2 have their names prefixed with 'D02'. For example, 'D02 - B63.mp3' corresponds to the listening task B63.
- If you don't print out 'D02 - Lesson.pdf', then please record your answers into your notebook.
- When you listen to the words, try to repeat them as loudly as possible. 

3- Within 5', quickly skim through 'D02 - Lesson.pdf' and take notes of what to remember in the section "The letter 'r' - pronounced or silent".

4- Within 10', give phonetic transcription for these sentences:
	When there is no vowel following it, /r/ is silent. However, this 'rule' only applies to some speakers of English, i.e. many native speakers always pronounce /r/.
Then let ImTranslator read the text and repeat it as loudly as possible.
	
5- Within 5', listen to file 'D02 - Pairs - D46.mp3'. Write down each word you here using this format:
	/pronunciation/ <word> - /pronunciation/ <word>
	E.g. /ʃiːp/ sheep - /ʃɪp/ ship
Note: This file helps you to distinguish /m/ and /n/ sounds.
	
You have finished day 2. Congratulations :)!
