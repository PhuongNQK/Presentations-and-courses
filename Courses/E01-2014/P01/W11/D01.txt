1- Review the lesson we learned in our class in less than 5'.

2- Within 35', listen to all files from 'D01 - C38a.mp3' to 'D01 - D42c.mp3'. Write down each word you here using this format:
	/pronunciation/ <word> - /pronunciation/ <word>
	E.g. /ʃiːp/ sheep - /ʃɪp/ ship
Note:
- You can listen to each file more than 1 time.
- 2 words in the same pair are different in only the phonemes we need to distinguish:
	'D01 - C38a.mp3': distinguish /f/ and /v/
	'D01 - C38b.mp3': distinguish /b/ and /v/	
	'D01 - D39.mp3': distinguish /v/ and /w/
	'D01 - D40.mp3': distinguish /dʒ/ and /j/
	'D01 - D41.mp3': distinguish (no sound) and /h/
	'D01 - D42a.mp3': distinguish /s/ and /θ/
	'D01 - D42b.mp3': distinguish /f/ and /θ/
	'D01 - D42c.mp3': distinguish /t/ and /θ/
	'D01 - D43a.mp3': distinguish /d/ and /ð/
	'D01 - D43b.mp3': distinguish /z/ and /ð/	
- Strategy to listen to each file:
	1st time: Go through the whole file without any pause and do not note anything. Focus on listening to distinguish the sounds.
	2nd time: Go through the whole file without any pause again. This time note as much as possible as you listen.
	3rd time (if needed): If you feel unsure about the results in the 2nd time, then go through the whole file without any pause one more time. This time focus on the 'unsure' parts.	
	If you still feel unsure after the 3rd time, then temporarily skip that file and continue with the next one. After finishing all files, return to those skipped files. 

3- Within 5', listen to 'D01 - Sound counting.mp3' at least twice. For each time, count and record the number of /əʊ/ sounds. 

4- Within 15', listen to all files in section 2- again. This time you do not need to note down anything. Just close your eyes, listen and quickly repeat. Can you easily distinguish the words in each minimal pair now? If not yet, try to spend more time practising again.
	
You have finished day 1. Congratulations :)!
