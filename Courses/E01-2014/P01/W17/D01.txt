3- Within 10', give phonetic transcription for these sentences:
	- 'Mm' has many meanings, depending on the intonation.
	- The weakly stressed words are said more quickly, and the pronunciation of some words changes if they are weakly stressed, e.g. of /ɒv/ becomes /əv/, is /ɪz/ becomes /z/ or /əz/, a is pronounced /ə/.

4- Within 12', read aloud these sections in 'D01 - Lesson.pdf':
- Minimal pairs (all words and sentences)

Record your voice into a file named 'D01 - Recording - <Your name>.mp3' and email it to me.
Note: You should compare your production with the provided recording.
	
You have finished day 1. Congratulations :)!
