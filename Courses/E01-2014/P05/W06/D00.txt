1- (15') Starter: Listen to this clip and try to understand as much as possible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JvSs9r8Wtw

2- (70') Main course/dish: Timed pair practice. 
Task: Open 'words.html' and read 6 new words you should use instead of 'VERY XXX', and make sentences based on them. Try to include as many words in a sentence as possible, and also keep the sentences as easy to remember as possible. It is great if you can also use the old words :).
