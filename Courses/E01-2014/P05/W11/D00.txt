1- (15') Starter: Listen to this clip and try to understand as much as possible: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTE8YypAEDg&list=PLiog3evUozPkRectiMy5Hx4aH9PPL-rB-&index=5

2- (85') Main course: Work in pair. Each member in a pair selects an exercise or a section in the book American Accent Training. Members in the same pair may select a similar exercise or section, but members in different pairs must select different exercises and sections. Then members in each pair talk to each other about their selection (what they understand, what they do not understand, how they can apply that, how they feel, etc.). Finally, when the time is over, each member reports to the class what he/she has discussed with his/her partner.
